## Thesis

I wrote my doctoral dissertation 

> **Gaussian Mixture Separation and
Denoising on Parameterized Varieties** (2022)

at the [Universität Konstanz](https://www.mathematik.uni-konstanz.de/en/), under the supervision of [Markus Schweighofer](https://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~schweigh/). I am very grateful to him and also to my unofficial, semi-voluntary co-supervisors, [Mateusz Michałek](https://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/~michalek/) and [Pravesh Kothari](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~praveshk/). The thesis is available from the [KOPS online repository of the Universität Konstanz](https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/entities/publication/352ae925-7b39-4f02-97ef-de1f07a7bbf5), and also on [GitHub](https://github.com/a44l/doctoral-thesis).
