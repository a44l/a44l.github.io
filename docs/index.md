## About Me

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, funded by the [OPTIMAL](https://optimal.uva.nl/?cb) project. My research applies techniques from Algebraic Geometry and semidefinite programming to problems from Statistics. Gaussian mixtures have been a central theme in my research, and I am particularly interested in the problems of identifiability and parameter recovery.
