## About Me

| ![portrait-louvre.jpg](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/apps/files_sharing/publicpreview/AnwcsFdscpDXsEg?file=/&fileId=129042088&x=3840&y=2160&a=true&etag=6f44fa9d42a13f683dbdb804deb76a79) |

| Me, in front of a simplex. |

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, funded by the [OPTIMAL](https://optimal.uva.nl/?cb) project. My research applies techniques from Algebraic Geometry and Semidefinite Programming to problems from Statistics. Gaussian mixtures have been a central theme in my research, and I am particularly interested in the problems of identifiability and parameter recovery for mixture distributions.
