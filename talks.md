## Talks

This is a recording of a talk on the topic of my recent [preprint on powers of forms decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06860), which I gave at the Oberwolfach workshop [Real Algebraic Geometry with a View toward Koopman Operator Methods](https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2311/www_view).  


 <!-- These are recordings of talks, which I gave at recent conferences.  -->
