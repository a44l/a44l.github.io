<http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03850>.  
Abstract: We resolve most cases of identifiability from sixth-order moments for Gaussian mixtures on spaces of large dimensions. Our results imply that the parameters of a generic mixture of m=Θ(n⁴) Gaussians on ℝ⁴ can be uniquely recovered from the mixture moments of degree 6. The constant hidden in the O-notation is optimal and equals the one in the upper bound from counting parameters. We give an argument that degree-4 moments never suffice in any nontrivial case, and we conduct some numerical experiments, indicating that degree 5 is minimal for identifiability.

Blomenhofer, Alexander Taveira. 2023. “Unique Powers-of-Forms Decompositions from Simple Gram
Spectrahedra.” <http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06860>.  
Abstract: We consider simultaneous Waring decompositions: Given forms of degrees k*d, (d=2,3), which admit a representation as d-th power sums of k-forms, when is it possible to reconstruct the individual terms from the power sums? Such powers-of-forms decompositions model the moment problem for mixtures of centered Gaussians. The novel approach of this paper is to use semidefinite programming in order to perform a reduction to tensor decomposition. The proposed method works on typical parameter sets at least as long as m≤n−1, where m is the rank of the decomposition and n is the number of variables. While provably not tight, this analysis still gives the currently best known rank threshold for decomposing third order powers-of-forms, improving on previous work in both asymptotics and constant factors. Our algorithm can produce proofs of uniqueness for specific decompositions. A numerical study is conducted on Gaussian random trace-free quadratics, giving evidence that the success probability converges to 1 in an average case setting, as long as m=n and n→∞. Some evidence is given that the algorithm also succeeds on instances of rank quadratic in the dimension.
