## About me 

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](www.cwi.nl) in Amsterdam, funded by the [OPTIMAL](https://optimal.uva.nl/?cb) project, and glad to be supervised by [Monique Laurent](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~monique/).

| Samples, which follow a Gaussian mixture distribution. |

My research applies techniques from Algebraic Geometry and Semidefinite Programming to problems from Statistics. Gaussian mixtures have been a central theme in my research, and I am particularly interested in the problems of identifiability and parameter recovery for mixture distributions. 

It is particularly fascinating to me, how classical subjects of 19th and 20th century geometry, such as the theory of Waring decompositions and Sums-of-Squares representations, are applied in cutting-edge algorithms and recovery results for high-dimensional estimation problems.
